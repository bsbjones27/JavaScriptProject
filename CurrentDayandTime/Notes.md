#### Creating JavaScript Array

	The Array object lets you store multiple values in a single variable. It stores a fixed-size
	sequential collection of elements of the same type.  An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

#### How to output in JavaScript

	Links to Learn Outputting in JavaScript:

#### The Question Mark (?) operator

		Links to Learn the Question Mark (?) Operator:
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
		https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-ternary-operator/

 		The question mark (?) is an alternative to an if statement best used in the case where one of two values will be assigned to a variable based on a conditional statement.

		The question mark operator takes in three (3) operands and can be referred to as the Ternary Operator.

		The Ternary Operator contains:
			* The condition lives in parentheses.
			* The value if true comes first
			* the value if false comes second.

		Example: (1 + 1 = 2) ? "Pass" : "Fail". Base on this example, it explain the question mark and the colon operators together are the ternary operator.

#### if-else conditional statement

	In JavaScript there are a number of conditional statements. The if is used to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified conditional is true. then the else is used to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.

#### Use of ES6 Syntax

Links to learn ES6:
